            In addition, as a special exception, Karl J. Runge gives permission
            to link the code of its release of x11vnc with the OpenSSL project&apos;s
            &quot;OpenSSL&quot; library (or with modified versions of it that use the
            same license as the &quot;OpenSSL&quot; library), and distribute the linked
            executables. You must obey the GNU General Public License in all
            respects for all of the code used other than &quot;OpenSSL&quot;. If you
            modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version
            of the file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not
            wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
